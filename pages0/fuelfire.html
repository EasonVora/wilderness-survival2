                <p>In wilderness survival, wood is a versatile and readily available fuel, ideal for building a long-lasting fire when properly seasoned and dry. Charcoal, although less common in the wild, offers a hotter and longer burn, making it valuable for cooking over extended periods. If you have access to it, alcohol-based fuels like denatured alcohol or ethanol can be highly efficient for portable stoves, providing a clean and controllable heat source. Lastly, various types of fire starters, such as tinder and kindling made from natural materials like pine needles or dry grass, are crucial for igniting a fire and sustaining it until larger fuel sources catch.</p>

                    <li><strong>Tinder: </strong><br> Small, easily ignitable material that from a spark or flame. <br><p class="example-text">E.g: leaves, pine needles, small wood shavings, cotton balls.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Kindling: </strong><br> Slightly bigger than tinder, kindling not only helps build the fire but also helps to sustain it. <br><p class="example-text">E.g: small sticks, twigs, small branches.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Firewood: </strong><br> These are larger pieces of wood that keep the fire burning longer. <br><p class="example-text">E.g: logs, thick branches, and chopped wood.</p></li>

                    <p>Fire saftey is a very serious topic. Improper fire management can cause forest fires, and wildfires. According to the National Park Service, humans are responsible for over 85% of wildfires in the United States, every year. <a class="articlelink" href="https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disasters/2024-north-american-wildfires/#:~:text=About%2085%25%20of%20U.S.%20wildfires%20are%20caused%20by%20people." target="_blank">(learn-more)</a></p>

                <h4>Impotant tips to remember<br><p> </p></h4>
                <ul class="firetiplist">
                    <li><p><strong>Choose a Safe Location:</strong><br> Set up your campfire in an established fire ring or pit, away from overhanging branches, dry grass, and other flammable materials. Make sure it's at least 15 feet away from tents and other structures.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Check for Local Regulations:</strong><br> Always follow local regulations and guidelines regarding campfires. Some areas may have fire bans or restrictions, especially during dry or high-risk seasons.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Prepare the Site:</strong><br> Clear the area around the fire pit of any leaves, grass, and other debris. Use rocks or a metal fire ring to contain the fire and prevent it from spreading.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Keep It Small:</strong><br> Build a fire that is manageable and within the size of the fire ring or pit. Large, uncontrolled fires can quickly become dangerous.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Use the Right Materials:</strong><br> Burn only dry, seasoned wood and avoid burning trash, plastics, or other materials that can release harmful chemicals.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Never Leave a Fire Unattended:</strong><br> Always keep an eye on the fire, and ensure that someone is responsible for managing it.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Have Fire Extinguishing Tools:</strong><br> Keep a bucket of water, a shovel, and a fire extinguisher nearby to quickly extinguish the fire if needed.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Extinguish the Fire Properly:</strong><br> When you're ready to put out the fire, make sure it's completely extinguished. Spread out the ashes, pour water over them, and stir until all embers are cold to the touch. Never leave a fire smoldering.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Be Mindful of Wind:</strong><br> Avoid starting a fire on windy days, as the wind can cause embers to blow and potentially start a wildfire.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Educate Yourself and Others:</strong><br> Ensure everyone in your group knows and follows campfire safety practices. Proper education helps in preventing accidents and promoting safety.</p></li>

                <h4>How Safely Start, Keep, and Put out a campfire<br><p> </p></h4>
                <ol class="firetiplist">
                    <li><strong>Choose the Right Location:</strong><br> Select a safe location for your campfire. Use an existing fire ring or pit if available. Ensure the site is away from overhanging branches, dry grass, and other flammable materials. The fire should be at least 15 feet away from tents and other structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Local Regulations:</strong><br> Verify and adhere to local regulations and fire bans. Some areas may have restrictions on campfires due to dry conditions or fire danger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the Site:</strong><br> Clear the area around the fire pit of any leaves, grass, and other debris. Create a fire ring with rocks or use a metal fire ring to contain the fire and prevent it from spreading.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather Materials:</strong><br> Collect and prepare your fuel. Start with tinder (small, easily ignitable materials like dry leaves or pine needles), followed by kindling (small sticks and twigs), and then firewood (larger pieces of wood).</li>
                    <li><strong>Build the Fire:</strong><br> Arrange your tinder in the center of the fire ring. Place kindling over the tinder in a crisscross pattern, allowing for air circulation. Add firewood on top, creating a tepee or log cabin structure for better airflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light the Fire:</strong><br> Use a match or a fire starter to ignite the tinder. Light the fire from the base and allow the kindling to catch fire. Once the kindling is burning well, the firewood should catch and sustain the fire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain the Fire:</strong><br> Keep the fire at a manageable size and add more wood as needed. Never leave the fire unattended. Ensure that someone is always responsible for monitoring the fire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extinguish the Fire Properly:</strong><br> When you're ready to put out the fire, spread out the ashes and embers. Gradually pour water over the fire, stirring the ashes to ensure all embers are fully extinguished. Make sure everything is cool to the touch before leaving the site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean Up:</strong><br> Leave the campsite clean and remove all leftover materials, including any unburned wood and ash. Ensure the area is in the same or better condition than you found it.</li>
